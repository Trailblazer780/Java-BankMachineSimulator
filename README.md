# PROG 1400 (Object Oriented Programming) Project 3
## Bank Machine Simulator

This program is written in Java and simulates using an ATM machine.

When you first start the program you can create an account. The account can either be a savings account or an airmiles savings account.
The airmiles account earns points when transactinos are made, the savings account is just a regular account. After the account is created
upon first start up of the application you can start making deposits and withdrawls which will reflect what appears in the "View". All transactions
that have been made on the selected account will appear there. If you have created more than one account you can use the "Select" button to flip
between which account you are making transactions with. If you wish to remove the account you currently have selected you can then click the "Delete" button
and the account will be removed and all data will be deleted.
